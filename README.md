# velocity-stack
This repository contains the code documentation for a velocity stack system that dynamically adjusts its length based on the engineâ€™s RPM. The system measures engine RPM using a crankshaft position sensor and adjusts the length of the stack for smoothing the torque-RPM curve. This project is designed for a specific motorcycle prototype.
